# 🚀 CodeAlpha C++ Internship Projects

This repository contains **three complete C++ console applications** developed as part of the **CodeAlpha C++ Internship Program**.

Each project addresses a specific task assigned by CodeAlpha and demonstrates strong understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**, **program structure**, and **user interaction** using **modern C++**.

## ✅ Task 1: CGPA Calculator

📁 **Project Folder:** `CodeAlpha_CGPA_Calculator`

### 🎯 Task Description
The CGPA Calculator computes a student's academic performance across multiple semesters.

### ✔ Features Implemented
- Input number of courses per semester
- Input grade and credit unit for each course
- Automatic calculation of:
  - Total credit units
  - Total grade points
  - Semester GPA
  - Overall CGPA
- Display of:
  - Individual course grades
  - Semester GPA
  - Final CGPA
- Intelligent grouping of semesters into academic years  
  *(2 semesters = 1 academic year)*

✔ Fully meets **CodeAlpha Task 1 requirements**
